I am a fullstack JavaScript developer from Sweden with experience in TypeScript, React and Node.js. Before becoming a developer I worked in Sales and Service as a Sales Teamleader and Kitchen Consultant. I found my passion for coding through hobby coding and my huge IT interest. Working in a team developing intuitive apps or services is what I love doing, and always strive to improve and learn new things.
